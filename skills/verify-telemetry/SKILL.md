# Verify Telemetry

Confirm that a running demo stack is sending telemetry to Datadog. Uses the Datadog MCP server — no fallback.

## Prerequisites

- Demo stack running (`docker compose up -d`)
- Datadog MCP server configured and accessible
- `.env` populated with valid `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_SITE`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check MCP availability

Attempt to list services using the Datadog MCP tools. If MCP tools are not available, stop and inform the user:

```
Datadog MCP server is required for telemetry verification.
Setup: https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-mcp-server
```

Do not proceed without MCP — partial checks would give false confidence.

### Step 2: Read project config

Extract from project files:
- `docker-compose.yml` → list of application service names (exclude datadog-agent, traffic, postgresql, redis, keycloak)
- `.env` → `DD_ENV` value (used to scope all queries)
- `AGENTS.md` → active features (check for mentions of "Database Monitoring", "RUM", "Profiling")
- Note whether a frontend service exists

### Step 3: Check service registration

For each application service, query the Datadog service catalog via MCP.

Report: service found with correct `env` tag, or FAIL with diagnostic hint.

### Step 4: Check logs

For each service, search recent logs (last 15 minutes) via MCP, scoped to `service:<name> env:<dd_env>`.

Verify:
- Logs exist (count > 0)
- At least one log contains `dd.trace_id` (trace-log correlation is working)

Report: log count + correlation status, or FAIL with diagnostic hint.

### Step 5: Check traces

Search recent traces/spans via MCP, scoped to `env:<dd_env>`.

Verify:
- Spans exist for each service
- At least one trace contains spans from 2+ different services (distributed tracing works)

Report: trace count + multi-service trace found, or FAIL with diagnostic hint.

### Step 6: Check correlation

Perform cross-signal verification:

- **Log-to-trace**: Pick a trace_id from a log entry, fetch that trace via MCP, confirm it exists
- **Trace-to-log**: Pick a trace_id from a span, search logs for that trace_id, confirm correlated logs exist
- **RUM-to-backend** (if frontend active): Search RUM events via MCP, check they carry backend trace_ids
- **DBM** (if Database Monitoring active): Search for database query spans with DBM metadata

Report each check as PASS or FAIL with diagnostic hint.

### Step 7: Report

Present a structured checklist grouping all results:

```
Service Registration
  [PASS] api-gateway (env: my-demo-260331)
  [PASS] user-service
  ...

Logs
  [PASS] api-gateway — 142 logs, trace correlation OK
  ...

Traces
  [PASS] Distributed trace found: api-gateway → user-service → project-service

Correlation
  [PASS] Log-to-trace roundtrip
  [PASS] Trace-to-log roundtrip
  ...
```

For each FAIL, include the diagnostic hint from `references/diagnostic-hints.md`.

End with a summary: "X/Y checks passed. [All clear / N issues to fix]"

## Constraints

- **Readonly** — never modify the project, docker-compose, or Datadog configuration
- **MCP-only** — use Datadog MCP tools exclusively
- **Stop cleanly** if MCP is unavailable
- **Idempotent** — can be run repeatedly as the SE fixes issues
